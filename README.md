### **Purpose and Vision**

The main aim of ShopImpact is to make people aware of the hidden environmental costs behind the products they purchase. Often, everyday shopping decisions ‚Äî such as buying a T-shirt or a new pair of shoes ‚Äî have unseen carbon footprints associated with manufacturing, packaging, and transport. ShopImpact helps bring this to light in a simple, engaging way.

Instead of overwhelming users with numbers or data, the app turns the process into a visual and playful experience. Each time someone adds a new purchase, the app shows a colorful animation, displays inspiring quotes about the environment from movies and famous figures, and offers tips for better, eco-friendly choices. In this way, the app not only measures but **motivates** sustainable action.

### **Design and Interface**

From the moment a user opens the app, ShopImpact stands out with its **neon aesthetic**. Every page has its own distinct color theme ‚Äî from cool electric greens on the Dashboard to glowing violets and hot pinks on the Add Purchase page. This design choice reflects the idea that sustainability can be **vibrant and exciting**, not dull or restrictive.

To make the navigation smooth, each page has a **subtle fade-in transition**. Instead of harsh page reloads, the content gently fades into view, giving the illusion of fluid motion. This small touch makes the app feel elegant and modern.

The sidebar menu allows easy navigation between four main sections:

1. **Add Purchase**
2. **Dashboard**
3. **History & Export**
4. **Settings & About**

Each section is carefully designed with a mix of bright colors, glowing accents, and playful typography ‚Äî while still keeping everything readable and well organized.

### **Add Purchase: The Heart of the App**

The Add Purchase page is the centerpiece of ShopImpact. It‚Äôs large, bold, and full of color. Users enter details about their purchase ‚Äî including the product type, product name, **brand (which is required)**, price, and date. There‚Äôs also an option to mark whether the brand is eco-friendly or ethical.

Once the user clicks ‚ÄúAdd Purchase,‚Äù the app instantly calculates the estimated **CO‚ÇÇ impact** using a built-in multiplier for each product category. The page then comes alive with gentle **neon pulse effects** and floating icons like üå±üíöüåø‚ú® drifting upward ‚Äî giving the sense of celebration when someone logs a purchase.

At the same time, the app displays suggestions to help users make better future choices. For example, if the user adds a fast-fashion item, ShopImpact might recommend buying second-hand or renting for special occasions. If they choose an eco-brand, the app rewards them with a ‚ÄúNeon Eco Badge.‚Äù

This page also features rotating **quotes** from environmental activists, films, and thinkers such as Greta Thunberg, Jane Goodall, and lines from *Avatar* or *Wall-E*. These quotes appear in different styles and fonts to keep the interface lively and inspirational.

### **Dashboard: Tracking Impact with Neon Energy**

The Dashboard transforms the data into vibrant visualizations. It shows total spending, total purchases, and total estimated CO‚ÇÇ impact. Monthly summaries are displayed in glowing green and cyan charts, powered by Matplotlib. The user can instantly see how their consumption habits change over time.

The app also rewards users with monthly badges based on their impact:

* **Eco Saver ‚Äî Neon Leaf** (lowest footprint)
* **Green Shopper ‚Äî Neon Bronze**
* **Conscious Shopper ‚Äî Neon Silver**
* **Eco Advocate ‚Äî Neon Gold**

These badges motivate users to stay consistent and celebrate progress rather than perfection. The Dashboard, with its glowing bars and electric color palette, makes sustainability feel like an adventure game ‚Äî each month offering a chance to ‚Äúlevel up‚Äù as a greener shopper.

### **History & Export: Transparency and Sharing**

Every entry added in the app is stored in an internal dataset. The **History & Export** page allows users to review all their past purchases in a clean neon-themed table. They can filter by month or product category and instantly download their data as a CSV file.

There‚Äôs also an option to generate a **quick visual report** ‚Äî a simple PNG image summarizing top categories, spending, and total impact. This feature is especially useful for presentations, reports, or assignments, as it gives a professional, visual overview of the user‚Äôs shopping habits.

### **Settings & About: Personalization and Learning**

The Settings & About page provides transparency about how ShopImpact works. It explains that the app calculates impact using **category-based multipliers**, meaning each product type has a different environmental weight. For instance, electronics or leather shoes have a higher footprint than fresh groceries or second-hand clothes.

Here, users can also adjust the multipliers manually, experiment with data, and learn how different consumption choices influence their carbon totals. This turns ShopImpact into both a **learning tool** and a **data simulator**.

---

### **Technical Highlights**

ShopImpact is coded entirely in **Python**, using the **Streamlit** library for web interactivity. Other libraries include **Pandas** for data handling and **Matplotlib** for chart visualization. The entire app runs through the browser, requiring no installations. Users can deploy it directly from a GitHub repository to **Streamlit Cloud**, where it automatically creates a live web link for access and sharing.

Animations, floating icons, and transitions are handled through **custom HTML and CSS** inside Streamlit, blending aesthetics with performance. The result is a seamless, responsive interface that looks and feels like a modern web application rather than a simple script.

### **Conclusion**

ShopImpact isn‚Äôt just an academic project ‚Äî it‚Äôs a creative expression of how technology, color, and purpose can come together for environmental awareness. By combining data visualization, playful design, and motivational elements, it turns sustainability into something engaging and enjoyable.

Each click, glow, and animation reflects a simple but powerful message: **small choices make a big impact**. Whether it‚Äôs switching to a local product, buying fewer packaged goods, or celebrating a ‚ÄúNeon Leaf‚Äù badge, ShopImpact helps users build a deeper connection with the planet ‚Äî one purchase at a time.
